					<h2>Air Quality Index</h2>
					<p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) is used for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for you. The AQI focuses on health effects you may experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air.</p>

					<p>The Water Quality Index (WQI) is a numerical expression used to represent the overall quality of water in a particular location. It takes into account various physical, chemical, and biological parameters of water and condenses them into a single value.</p>

				<h3>Preventions</h3>
				<p>The less gasoline we burn, the better we are doing to reduce air pollution and harmful effects of climate change. Make good choices about transportation. When you can, walk, ride a bike, or take public transportation. For driving, choose a car that gets better miles per gallon of gas, or choose an electric car. You can also investigate your power provider options—you may be able to request that your electricity be supplied by wind or solar. Buying your food locally cuts down on the fossil fuels burned in trucking or flying food in from across the country.</p>

						<h3>Causes</h3>
						<p>Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a “universal solvent,” water is able to dissolve more substances than any other liquid on earth. Water pollution can usually be attributed to one of four sources: sewage, industry, agriculture, and urban runoff including stormwater. For example, releasing inadequately treated wastewater into natural waters can lead to degradation of these aquatic ecosystems. Water pollution can also lead to water-borne diseases for people using polluted water for drinking, bathing, washing or irrigation.</p>
					</div>
								
					<div class="proswater">
						<h3>Preventions</h3>
						<p>Reduce your plastic consumption and reuse or recycle plastic when you can.
							Properly dispose of chemical cleaners, oils, and nonbiodegradable items to keep them from going down the drain.
							Maintain your car so it does not leak oil, antifreeze, or coolant. Be mindful of anything you pour into storm sewers, since that waste often won’t be treated before being released into local waterways. If you notice a storm sewer blocked by litter, clean it up to keep that trash out of the water.
							Don't put fertilizer on the grass right before it rains. The chemicals will wash into storm drains and waterways.
						</p>
					</div>
								
					<div class="proswater">
						<h3>Facts</h3>
						<p>Approximately 785 million people in the world do not have access to clean drinking water because of pollution. Around 70% of the industrial waste is dumped into the water bodies where they pollute the usable water supply. Industry dumps an estimated 300-400 MT of polluted waste into water bodies every year. It includes millions of tonnes of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge and other wastes. Fourteen billion pounds of garbage, mostly plastic, is dumped into the ocean every year. 15 million children under the age of five die each year because of diseases caused by drinking water</p>
